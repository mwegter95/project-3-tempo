  ## Description
  Tempo is aimed at connecting bands and musicians together through media sharing. 
  
  Users can sign up or login into the site and select whether they are a 'Band' or a 'Musician'. They set their status, options include just browsing, open to collaborations, or looking for a new band member. Musicians will post links of their performances on the site, adding a title, description, and most importantly metadata such as instruments and genres. This allows other users to use the Discover page and search for criteria they are looking for (i.e. electric bass guitarists). Once a user is filtered then you can click into their profile, see all their linked performances, and review them. Reviews are for personal use only and will not be shared with the users being reviewed. This provides bands a way to track who they like and why. When you are interested in someone you can contact them via email from the site.
